# Python: Getting Started

A barebones Django app, which can easily be deployed to Heroku.

This application supports the [Getting Started with Python on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) article - check it out.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have Python 3.7 [installed locally](http://install.python-guide.org). To push to Heroku, you'll need to install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli), as well as [Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/python-getting-started.git
$ cd python-getting-started

$ python3 -m venv getting-started
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ createdb python_getting_started

$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py collectstatic

$ heroku local
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Deploying to Heroku

```sh
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master

$ heroku run python manage.py migrate
$ heroku open
```
